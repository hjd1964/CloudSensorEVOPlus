# CloudSensorEvoPlus
Cloud, rain, temperature, (optional) barometric pressure, and (optional) humidity sensing.  An Arduino Ethernet (W5100) adapter can be added and the built-in website can then be used for monitoring sensor data.  The ASCOM safety monitor driver is also supported.

This is the Cloud Sensor Evo Plus.

For the Arduino Atmega 2560, Atmega 328, the Nano, Uno etc.
You need the libraries (can be downloaded via the library handler in the arduino program)
- OneWire
- Adafruit_MLX90614

Libraries for the BMP180 and HTU21D are built-in.  The Mega2560 is required for full functionality.

See the "Cloud Sensor Evo Plus.doc" for more detail
